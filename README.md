# Meta Ads Growth Analytics Case Study

## Executive Summary
I analyzed Meta Ads performance (creative + audience + placement) and the acquisition funnel (ad view → click → install → registration → onboarding completion) to guide weekly budget and optimization decisions.

**Week 4 highlights:**
- CPM decreased ~10% after a prior spike; expected variance due to placement mix and optimization behavior.
- CPC increased ~5% WoW, while **CPI improved ~31% to €5.63** (best YTD).
- Funnel improvements were partially offset by weaker onboarding completion; still **CPR improved ~13% to €30.65**.
- Placement test (Campaign 3) delivered **low CPM (€10.66)** with **CPI €6.04** and **CPR €26.19** (early days / small numbers).

## Context & Goal 
**Business objective:** Acquire users likely to convert into paying subscribers.  
**Primary question:** Which creatives / placements / audiences should we scale, and what should we change next week?

## Data Sources (High level)
- Meta Ads reporting: CPM, CPC, CPI, CPR; breakdowns by placement and audience segments.
- Product funnel + onboarding steps.

## Approach - How I analyzed
1) Weekly performance review of cost metrics (CPM/CPC/CPI/CPR) and trend context.
2) Creative & placement evaluation (identify early “winners” and underfunded segments).
3) Funnel review for conversion bottlenecks (registration + onboarding completion).

## Key Findings
### 1) Acquisition cost improved at the install and registration stages
- CPI reached **€5.63** (best YTD), indicating improved install efficiency.
- CPR improved to **€30.65**, despite onboarding weakness.

### 2) Placement test showed promising early efficiency
- Campaign 3 (placement test) showed strong cost structure:
  - CPM €10.66
  - CPI €6.04
  - CPR €26.19
- Interpreted as early signal; requires more volume for confidence.

### 3) Onboarding became the bottleneck
- Week 5 onboarding funnel showed drop-offs after users started onboarding.
- The funnel artifact indicates total users reaching "New User Created" vs started onboarding.

## Actionable next steps - What I Recommended 
- Continue optimizing toward meaningful conversion signals (avoid optimizing only for cheap upper-funnel actions).
- Scale/continue the placement test cautiously while monitoring stability over the next 1–2 weeks.
- Prioritize onboarding fixes for the highest drop-off steps.

## Limitations
- Some data and dashboards cannot be shared publicly.
- Results include “small numbers” periods; interpretation emphasizes directionality + decision frameworks.

## Next Steps (v2)
- Add audience breakdown (age/placement mix) + show how budget distribution shifted.
- Add 1 “decision table”: what we changed, why, and what we expected to happen.
